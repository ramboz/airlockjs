VERDICT: pass

REASONING:
No craft blockers in the bounded local harness, invented CLI, tests and README. Qualification/render/click/failure sequence and immutable accounting are consistent. Controls exercise behavior. Read-only review, no independently rerun tests/vendorSDK/architecture certification.

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- [strength][impl] stock-harness.mjs:107 rejects foreign scope/provider/unsafe content/duplicate results before rendering.
- [strength][impl] stock-harness.mjs:158 timeout settlement cannot resume later calls; fixed safe errors ignore thrown-object text.
- [strength][impl] adobe-stock-harness.test.js:453 tests stage timeout/late settlement, false host acknowledgement and void ACDL.
- [strength][impl] README.md:377 distinguishes submissions from HTTP, asynchronous completion and product receipt.

RECONCILIATION NOTES:
No deviation. Local-only claims do not clear expired routing/deployment/observation gates. Do not reinstate owner-retired audience/marker requirements.
